        -mem : MEM bitmask (in hex)
                Specify the cpu(s) in bitmask for the memory test.
                The default value is all 1's (64-bit).

        -memcore[#] : Core bitmask of this CPU# (in hex)
                Specify the core(s) in bitmask for the memory test.
                The default value is all 1's (64-bit).

        -cp : CPU power level <100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50>
                Specify the power level to stress the CPU.
                The default value is 100.
                NOTE: this option is for Core power level test only.

        -mp : Memory power level <100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50>
                Specify the power level to stress the memory.
                The default value is 100.

        -ct : CPU test selection
                0 = None.
                1 = TDP test.
                2 = Core power level test.
                3 = Core AVX test.
                4 = PMAX test.     
                5 = PMAX.App test.
                The default value is 1.

        -mt : Memory test selection
                0 = None.
                1 = Read only test.
                2 = Write only test.
                3 = Read/Write test.
                The default value is 0.

        -mr : Memory read/write type
                0 = Read only.
                1 = Write only.
                2 = Read/Write (20/80).
                The default value is 2.

        -md : Memory data type
                0 = All 0's.

                The default value is 2.

        -t : Run time
                Specify the time in seconds to run the test.
                Run time = 0 means test will run forever.
                The default value is 0.

        -en : Enable near-TDP
               Specifies this option to enable near-TDP feature.
               Near-TDP feature is only applicable for TDP test with sample parts.
